## Planning
- **Define Accessibility Goals and Requirements**
  - Identify target accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA).
  - Consider user personas that include people with disabilities.

- **Training and Awareness**
  - Schedule accessibility training for the team.
  - Share resources on accessibility best practices.

## Design
- **Accessible Design Principles**
  - Use sufficient contrast ratios.
  - Design for keyboard-only and screen reader users.

- **Design Review**
  - Conduct accessibility reviews of wireframes and mockups.
  - Utilize tools like color contrast analyzers and design checklists.

## Development
- **Coding Standards**
  - Follow semantic HTML practices.
  - Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and operable.

- **Use of ARIA**
  - Implement ARIA roles and properties where necessary.
 
### Accessibility Linting Tools

- **ESLint with Accessibility Plugins** – ESLint-plugin-jsx-a11y: This is a static AST checker for accessibility rules on JSX elements. When using React, this plugin helps enforce accessibility practices directly in your code.
ESLint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility: For Vue.js projects, this plugin checks elements in .vue files for accessibility issues.
- **Stylelint-a11y** – A plugin that enforces CSS rules that are important for accessibility, such as color contrast and text size.

## Testing
- **Automated Testing**
  - Integrate accessibility testing tools (e.g., Axe, Pa11y, Lighthouse) into the CI/CD pipeline.

- **Manual Testing**
  - Conduct screen reader tests with actual users.
  - Perform keyboard-only navigation testing.

## Deployment
- **Accessibility Statement**
  - Publish an up-to-date accessibility statement on the website.

- **User Feedback**
  - Provide a mechanism for users to report accessibility issues.

## Maintenance
- **Regular Audits**
  - Schedule regular accessibility audits to ensure ongoing compliance.

- **Update Training**
  - Keep the development team updated on the latest accessibility standards and tools.
